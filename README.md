# Packer Corpus Orchestrator

**Automated Framework for Generating Packed Executable Datasets**

This repository serves as the "Orchestrator" for the **Leal Security Lab** automated packing research project. It manages the acquisition of benign executable sources, the configuration of packer tools, and the automated generation of packed artifacts for malware analysis and evasion research.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This project uses **Git Submodules** to keep heavy binary data (`inputs`, `tools`, `outputs`) separate from the logic.

```text
packer-corpus/
├── benign_sources/       # [Submodule] Input datasets (Linked to 'inputs' repo)
│   └── manifest/         # JSON tracking files (processed_ids.json, x64.json)
├── packers/              # [Submodule] Packer binaries (Linked to 'tools' repo)
│   └── exe32pack/
├── manifest/             # Configuration

├── utils/                # Python Automation Scripts

│   └── update_manifest.py
├── pyproject.toml        # Dependency definitions
└── uv.lock               # Lockfile for reproducible builds
```

Note: `packed_sources/` (the generated output artifacts) is **not committed to this repo** — it's produced by GitHub Actions runs and published to a separate `outputs` repo.

# 🚀 Prerequisites & Installation

This framework is designed for Windows environments (required for winget and PE-specific packers).

## 1. Install winget (Windows Package Manager)

Most modern Windows 10/11 builds have this pre-installed.

- **Check if you have it:** Open PowerShell and type `winget`.
- **If missing:** Install the "App Installer" from the Microsoft Store.

## 2. Install uv (Fast Python Package Manager)

We use `uv` for extremely fast dependency management and script execution. Run the following command in PowerShell:
```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

## 3. Install Go (required for amber v2.0)

amber v2.0 shells out to `go build` to compile its runtime stub. The prebuilt amber.exe predates Go modules (no `go.mod` in its tree), so Go 1.21+ must be told to use the legacy GOPATH build mode.

- **Recommended:** Install Go via Scoop (`scoop install go`) — the runner auto-detects `C:\Users\<you>\scoop\shims\go.exe`.
- **Manual:** Install Go from <https://go.dev/dl/> and ensure `go.exe` is on `PATH`.

The runner also sets `GO111MODULE=off` automatically for `amber_v2.0`, so you don't need to change your global Go config.

## 4. Clone the Repository

Because this repo uses submodules, you must use the `--recurse-submodules` flag to pull the linked projects immediately.
```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/BaylorSecurityLab/packing_pipeline.git
cd packing_pipeline
```

**Already cloned without submodules?** Run this to fix it:
```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## 5. Install Dependencies

Initialize the environment and install dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`.
```powershell
uv sync
```

## 6. Install WSL2 (required for PEzor)

PEzor shells into WSL2 to compile its C++ stub. Other packers are pure Windows binaries and don't need WSL.

```powershell
wsl --install
# Reboot if prompted, then set the default distro:
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

Inside WSL, install the build toolchain PEzor needs (clang, make, git):
```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu-26.04 -u root -- bash -c 'apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential clang git'
```

Verify with `wsl --status` — you should see `Default Version: 2`.

# 🛠️ Usage Guide

All scripts are located in the `utils/` folder. You should execute them from the project root using `uv run`.

## Phase 1: Acquire Data (Benign Sources)

This script queries the Winget API, downloads distinct executables, extracts them from installers/zips, and categorizes them into `benign_sources/x64` and `benign_sources/x86`.
```powershell
uv run utils/benign_source_downloader.py
```

- **Configuration:** Adjust the `LIMIT` variable inside the script to change how many samples are fetched per run.
- **Manifests:** It automatically tracks downloaded IDs in `benign_sources/manifest/processed_ids.json` to avoid duplicates.

## Phase 2: Run Packing Experiments

This script reads `manifest/packer_corpus.yaml` and executes defined test cases against your benign sources.

### Basic Usage:
```powershell
# Syntax: uv run utils/packer_runner.py <packer_name> [options]

# Example: Run 'exe32pack' test cases
uv run utils/packer_runner.py exe32pack
```

### Advanced Usage (Size Filtering):

Some shareware packers (like evaluation versions) have strict file size limits. You can filter inputs automatically:
```powershell
# Only pack files smaller than 80KB
uv run utils/packer_runner.py exe32pack --max-size-kb 80
```

### PEzor WSL worker count:

PEzor shells into WSL2 and compiles C++ per job. By default it runs **4 concurrent `wsl.exe` invocations**; bump it with `--wsl-workers N` (the runner caps N at the per-packer ceiling of 8 and logs the effective value at start-up):
```powershell
# Default 4 — fine for most boxes
uv run utils/packer_runner.py pezor

# Custom worker count (capped at 8 by the runner's per-packer ceiling)
uv run utils/packer_runner.py pezor --wsl-workers 6
```
The memory-budget scheduler is the real throttle for PEzor — the worker count is just an upper bound on simultaneous `wsl.exe` launches. If you raise `--wsl-workers` and the WSL VM OOMs, lower it.

## Phase 2b: Run GUI Packers

Some packers (FSG, Themida, Obsidium, Yoda's Crypter/Protector, PECompact, ZProtect, …) are **GUI-only** and cannot be scripted through `packer_runner.py`. They are driven by GUI-automation wrappers in `wrapper/` (built on `pyautogui` / `win32gui`) and orchestrated by **`wrapper/gui_runner.py`**.

> ⚠️ **Run on an interactive Windows desktop.** These wrappers move the real mouse and keyboard and need a visible screen — they will **not** work headless, over SSH, or in CI. Don't touch the machine while a run is in progress.

Paths are resolved relative to the script, so run these from the project root:
```powershell
# Pack every compatible file in benign_sources/x86 with FSG
uv run python wrapper/gui_runner.py --packer fsg_v1.0

# Smoke-test on a single input first (recommended)
uv run python wrapper/gui_runner.py --packer fsg_v1.0 --limit 1

# Pack one specific file
uv run python wrapper/gui_runner.py --packer fsg_v1.0 --file "benign_sources\x86\example.exe"

# Run every GUI packer in sequence
uv run python wrapper/gui_runner.py --packer all
```

Output goes to `packed_sources/<packer>_<version>/` (e.g. `packed_sources/fsg_v1.0_1.0/`). Already-packed inputs are skipped by default.

### Common options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--packer <name>` | GUI packer to run (`fsg_v1.0`, `themida_v3.2.4.34`, …), or `all` for every one |
| `--file <path>` | Pack a single file instead of the whole batch |
| `--limit N` | Only process the first N files |
| `--dry-run` | List the files that would be packed, without packing |
| `--no-skip` | Re-pack files even if output already exists |
| `--recursive` | Scan sub-directories of the source dir |
| `--exclude <p1 p2>` | With `--packer all`, skip these packers |
| `--source-dir <dir>` | Input directory (default `benign_sources/x86`) |
| `--output-dir <dir>` | Override the output directory |
| `--list-packers` | List all GUI packers and their supported file types |
| `--packer-info <name>` | Show a packer's configurable options |

> ℹ️ FSG specifically needs a **PE32 / x86** input with an **ASCII-only path**, ideally **< 80 KB** — incompatible files trip a TLS dialog and are skipped automatically.

# 🔒 SHA Quality Gate

Every produced sample is verified against a **SHA-256 gate** before it lands in `packed_sources/`. The gate prevents two recurring contamination classes from ever being published:

1. **Pass-throughs** — the packer returned the input bytes unchanged (`sha_out == sha_in`).
2. **Cross-packer duplicates** — the same SHA-256 already exists under a *different* `<packer>_<version>` directory (proves an unpacked original leaked in, or two packers produced identical bytes).

Both runners wire the same `utils/sha_gate.ShaGate` instance into their `pack_single_file` / `run_packer` paths, so a single rejected output is removed before any further accounting and surfaces in the final report as `PACK_FAILED_PASSTHROUGH`, `PACK_OUTPUT_MATCHES_OTHER_INPUT`, or `PACK_DUP_ACROSS_PACKERS`.

### Enable / disable

| Runner | Flag |
|---|---|
| `utils/packer_runner.py` | `--sha-gate` (default) / `--no-sha-gate` |
| `wrapper/gui_runner.py`  | `--sha-gate` (default) / `--no-sha-gate` |

`--no-sha-gate` is an escape hatch for diagnostic re-runs. The default is on; ship a PR that requires disabling it and reviewers will ask why.

### State files (under `packed_sources/_audit/`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `published_shas.jsonl` | Authoritative cross-packer state. Reconciled with the on-disk tree (`size` + `mtime_ns`) at every launch so the 30 k+ file corpus does not require a full rehash. |
| `manifest.jsonl` | Append-only provenance log. One row per `verify_pack` call (accepted or rejected). |

Both runners share the audit dir; the gate reconciles state on startup so two processes launched back-to-back see each other's published outputs.

# 🧹 Cleanup pass (`utils/nas_cleanup.py`)

Once a SHA gate is in place it stops new contamination, but the existing corpus may already contain unpacked originals and pass-throughs. The cleanup pass walks `packed_sources/`, finds them, and moves them to `packed_sources/_quarantine/` (never deletes in place).

```powershell
# 1) Walk every .exe and write _audit/nas_inventory.jsonl (~30 k rows, minutes)
uv run python utils/nas_cleanup.py inventory

# 2) Diff the inventory against benign_sources/x86 and emit flagged rows
#    + a human-readable Markdown report.
uv run python utils/nas_cleanup.py report

# 3) Review packed_sources/_audit/nas_cleanup_report.md, then move
#    flagged files into packed_sources/_quarantine/. Idempotent;
#    refuses stale data; blocks packer_dirs that would drop below 2
#    genuine samples (those surface as "needs re-packing").
uv run python utils/nas_cleanup.py quarantine
```

Pass `--packed-root <dir>` / `--benign-dir <dir>` to point the script at a copy of the corpus (e.g. a snapshot on a different drive) — defaults are the live repo paths.

Outputs land under `<packed_root>/_audit/` and `<packed_root>/_quarantine/`.

# ⚙️ Configuration (packer_corpus.yaml)

The `manifest/packer_corpus.yaml` file is the source of truth for the experiment. It defines:

- **Packer Definitions:** Paths to binaries (in `packers/`), checksums, and metadata.
- **Test Cases:** Specific command-line arguments to run (e.g., "Maximum Compression", "Re-alignment").

### Example Entry:
```yaml
  - id: "EXE32PACK_001_DEFAULT"
    <<: *exe32pack_v142
    command_label: "Default Auto-Compression"
    cli_template: "{bin} /M:0 {in} {out}"
```

# ⚠️ Important Notes

## Antivirus Interference:

The `packed_sources/` directory will contain obfuscated binaries that will trigger Windows Defender or other AV solutions.

**Action:** Add a folder exclusion in Windows Security for your entire `packer-corpus` directory.

## Git Submodules:

If you need to update the tools or inputs, go into their respective folders (`packers/` or `benign_sources/`), pull changes, and then commit the new reference in the main repo.
